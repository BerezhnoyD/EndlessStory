    <string name="text_instructions">Environment: You stand at the edge of a dense, primeval forest. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and pine needles. A narrow path leads deeper into the woods, disappearing beneath a canopy of ancient trees. In the distance, you hear the faint melody of a flute, its haunting tune carried on the breeze. To the east, you see a glimmer of sunlight through the trees, suggesting a possible clearing. The gnarled branches of the trees reach towards the sky, their leaves rustling in the gentle wind. The forest floor is covered in a carpet of moss and fallen leaves, damp and soft beneath your feet.
        Character: You have been traveling for days, following the whispers of rumors and the faintest of trails, hoping to find the legendary Lost City of Gold. You have been led here by a weathered map, its edges tattered and faded, but its markings still clear. You have just emerged from a thick thicket of thorns, your clothes torn and your skin scratched.
